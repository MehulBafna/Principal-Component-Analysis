# **Principal-Component-Analysis**

Large datasets are increasingly very common in varied area of studies. In order to obtain meaningful information from such complex datasets, techniques are needed for dimensionality reduction in an effective way, without much loss of the original information in the data. Although various approaches have been proposed for this purpose still principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most widespread one.
The fundamental aim behind PCA is the dimensionality reduction of a dataset along with preserving as much statistical information as possible.
